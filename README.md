# YOLOv8 OBJECT DETECTION ON CUSTOM DATA 

"Transforming data into insights with YOLOv8 Object Detection  
where every pixel reveals a story, and precision meets the art of intelligent detection."

##   `Step 1`      

* Gather your dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/), whether it is a video or an image, as your preference.

##   `Step 2`        

* Choose an annotation tool and start annotating your dataset. I suggest the [CVAT](https://app.cvat.ai/) Tool, as it is good for annotation."

* After finishing annotation, save the annotations by click on the three dots, select 'Export Task Dataset,' choose YOLO format, and click OK. Your annotation file for images will be saved in text format with their respective image names.

##   `Step 3`
